# Chapter 1 Introduction

## 1.1
Game engines all have similar core components. These components are also similiar and share designs.

Book will teach game engine architecture, I knew that, it's on the cover.

Engineering teams are broken up into runtime programmers and tool programmers with more specialization.

Artists create content: concept, 3D, graphical, animation, acting, voice, audio and music.

Game designers develop the actual gameplay and story.

Producers do management stuff.

Publishers publish games, studios build them.

## 1.2
Game philosophy, but books is focusing on big ticket video game engines.

Games are a mathmatical simulation of reality and approximate and simply the real world.

agent-based simulations and games are nicely represented by OOP.

Games are:
* temporal simulations
* dynamic
* interactive temporal simulations
* interactive realtime simulations

Users interact with the world and change its state.

Game engines use deadlines a concept to establish requirements such as fps, physics simulations or AI and audio.

Video games are soft real time systems, missed deadlines don't kill humans.

Mathmatic models can be analytics or numerical, game engines use a numerical model to determine the system at discrete time steps in a game loop. Results are rendered/heard/etc.

## 1.3

Game engines are data driven architecture that avoids hard coded gameplay logic and can be reused for making other games.

Game engines are usually genere specific, even generic ones have strengths suitable for specific genres.
