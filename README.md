# Foundations
This is an attempt to build a game engine and learn graphics programming in zig. This project is named after Eric Lengyel game engine series [Foundations of Game Engine Development](https://foundationsofgameenginedev.com/) which is pretty cool. THis project will be mostly in 
OpenGL but I might attempt a Vulkan triangle or two as well as try other things.

These are the books I am going to use to learn:
