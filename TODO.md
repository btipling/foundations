# TODOs

Things to try and do as I learn more about graphical programming

## Point, line, plane & polygon equation programs
- [ ] A program that lets you add and subtract vectors together visually to visually see displacement!
        - [ ] I need an arrow drawer!
- [ ] A program that draws a line and then a user clicks on the screen and it draws a new line from the original line. Reports distance to the line.
- [ ] A program that draws a line and a point, maybe a ray, and by interacting the user can add another point further down the line
- [ ] Detect if 3 or more points are collinear
- [ ] A program that draws a line from a plane to a point where the user may have clicked or used ui to create a point in 3D
- [ ] A program that detects if a point lies within a convex polyhederon by checking all of its planes using the generalized plane equation
- [ ] A frustum cull type operation that culls objects not within a set of planes but with it visible from the camera
- [ ] Determine if four points are coplanar or collinear via triple scalar product (cross products for collinear)
- [ ] Determine if a 3D point lying within a triangle plane lies within a triangle or external to it
- [ ] Write a program to describe the barycentric coordinates in a triangle 
- [ ] Given a generalized plane equation and a point, draw a plane
- [ ] Draw a cube or other polygon with normals, give a color to +Z different from the other normals to 
        prove that the +Z side by default faces the camera as NDC is a left handed coordinate system, the color should be the one facing the viewer
