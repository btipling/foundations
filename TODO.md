# TODOs

Things to try and do as I learn more about graphical programming

## Line equation programs
- [ ] A program that draws a line and then a user clicks on the screen and it draws a new line from the original line. Reports distance to the line.
- [ ] A program that draws a line and a point, maybe a ray, and by interacting the user can add another point further down the line
- [ ] Detect if 3 or more points are collinear
